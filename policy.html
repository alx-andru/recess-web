  <h1>Features of a Smart Phone App to Promote Physical Activity</h1>
  <p>
    Increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary time is important for overall health and wellness.
    However, many individuals are not active enough to meet recommended guidelines for health benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
    The purpose of this study is to determine which features of a smartphone application (app, called RECESS) are
    effective in improving daily physical activity and reducing sedentary (sitting, lying) time. Participation in this
    study will involve downloading RECESS.
    <br>
    You will then provide some information about yourself. The app will then download 1 week of your prior activity data
    (from Apple Health or Google Health) to provide information about your current activity. You will then use the
    RECESS app for three weeks.
    The features of RECESS will vary week to week so
    that we can investigate which features are more effective in promoting activity. The features may include goal
    setting and giving and receiving coaching from a buddy with similar activity levels and/or goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your participation is voluntary.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can withdraw from the study at any time by deleting RECESS from your smart
    phone. By indicating yes at the end of this information letter, you indicate your consent to participate in this
    study.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are no known or anticipated risks to participating in this study. It is important for you to know that any
    information that you provide and share will be anonymous and confidential. RECESS is programmed to collect responses
    and data by study ID. It will not collect any information that could potentially identify you (such as name or phone
    identifiers).
  </p>
  <p>
    The data collected through RECESS will be transmitted and stored in Firebase, which is a cloud service provided by
    Google. When information is transmitted over the internet (such as through Firebase), privacy cannot be guaranteed.
    There is always a risk your data may be intercepted by a third party (e.g., government agencies, hackers). The data
    will be electronically archived after completion of the study and maintained on an password protected, encrypted
    computer at the University of Waterloo for seven years and then erased.
  </p>
  <p>
    This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics
    Committee (ORE#xxxxx). If you have questions for the Committee contact the Chief Ethics Officer, Office of Research
    Ethics, at 1-519-888-4567 ext. 36005 or ore-ceo@uwaterloo.ca.
